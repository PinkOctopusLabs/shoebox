# Decisions and deviations from SPEC.md

Newest first. SPEC.md stays the source of truth; this records where we
deliberately differ and why.

## 2026-10-16 — ImageIO benchmark (for M2 thumbnails)
`shoebox_decode::imageio` is a thin FFI wrapper (ImageIO + CoreGraphics),
needed for HEIC in M2 anyway. RAW files need a UTI type hint, since a NEF
looks like a TIFF from its bytes. Real Z f files, median per image:

| Input | ours | ImageIO |
| --- | --- | --- |
| camera JPG 6048×4032 → 256 px | 110 ms | 58 ms |
| camera JPG → 1024 px | 132 ms | 33 ms |
| 48 JPGs in parallel → 256 px | 12.2 ms/img | 6.6 ms/img |
| Lightroom 16-bit TIFF 2560 px → 256 px | 6.5 ms | 15 ms |
| NEF → 256 px | 28 ms (JpgFromRaw + zune) | 78 ms |
| turbojpeg 1/8 scaled (reference) | 65 ms | |

Hashes from ImageIO differ from ours by 0–3 bits (different resampling and
gray conversion), so the two paths must never be mixed in one cache.

Decision: keep our decoders for **hashing** (deterministic, pure Rust, not
tied to macOS version changes; cached hashes stay valid). For **display**
thumbnails in M2, use ImageIO for JPEG and HEIC (2–4× faster, and it does
ICC colour management, which M2 requires), and our own path for NEF
(embedded preview) and TIFF.

## 2026-10-16 — Multi-index hash instead of a BK-tree
The spec names a BK-tree, but at radius 10 over 64-bit hashes a BK-tree visits
nearly every node, so grouping was quadratic (10k items: 2.19 s; 200k
infeasible). `dupes::mih` splits pHashes into four 16-bit chunks and probes
every bucket within 2 bits per chunk (pigeonhole), then verifies; radii above
15 fall back to a linear scan. Matching runs in parallel, assignment
sequentially. Benchmarks (random hashes, every 10th a near-copy):
10k 7.8 ms, 25k 25 ms, 100k 330 ms, 200k 1.47 s. Reports on the real-library
copy are byte-identical to the BK-tree version.

## 2026-10-16 — Fewer, better duplicate candidates
Measured on a copy of the real library (4,460 files) after the change above.
- **Siblings aren't duplicates.** Files in the same folder with the same base
  name (ignoring case, extension and `-N` suffixes, stripped only while the
  shorter name exists) are renditions of one frame. They match each other
  only exactly or by image data, never perceptually.
- **Blank and low-detail frames.** Luma stddev of the 256 px thumbnail is
  cached. ≤ 3 (blank, blown-out): no perceptual matching. ≤ 8 (mostly dark):
  only near-identical perceptual matches. Real library: blank = 0.0,
  p1 = 2.4, median = 45.
- **Keeper-centred groups replace union-find.** Every member matches its
  keeper directly; matches of matches no longer chain (largest group 991 → 52).
- **Different exposures are never suggested as duplicates.** If both files
  have a capture time and they differ, the row is `review` with a note and
  `same_exposure = no`. On the real library this covers 1,759 of 1,759
  remaining candidates (bursts and blank frames); filtering it out leaves 0.
- Real carved previews (40 `JpgFromRaw` extracted with exiftool) against the
  library as reference: 40/40 suggested `duplicate` at image-data level; 39
  matched their own NEF, 1 a byte-identical blank frame.

## 2026-10-16 — Duplicates are flagged, never moved automatically
A dry run on a copy of the real library showed that perceptual matches at the
spec's thresholds (≤ 4 / ≤ 10) also catch burst frames seconds apart and blank
frames across days: 64% of files had a *different* frame within distance 10.
So `shoebox dupes` only writes a report (with `suggestion` = duplicate/review
and an empty `confirm` column); `--move-matched` just fills the proposed
`dest`. `shoebox apply <report>` moves only rows a person marked `y`, after
re-checking each file's BLAKE3 against the report, refusing reference files,
and refusing to empty a group. The M4 review UI will follow the same rule.

## 2026-10-16 — M1 implementation choices
- Journal in its own `journal.sqlite`, not the rebuildable cache.
- Perceptual hashes stored for 0/90/180/270° for every file (carved previews
  may lack or misstate Orientation).
- Moves across volumes are refused (would need copy + delete).
- Sidecars move with their file; a shared `name.xmp` stays.
- walkdir instead of jwalk; own dHash/pHash instead of `image_hasher`.
- zune-jpeg kept over turbojpeg (1.84× gap on a 24 MP decode to 256 px,
  below the 2× bar; avoids a C dependency).
- Decodes capped at 200 MP to bound memory on hostile/corrupt headers.
